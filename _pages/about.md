Xiong Junwu is dedicated to cutting-edge research on **Scalable Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Agentic Alignment from AI to AGI**, aiming to bridge the gap between specialized artificial intelligence and general-purpose autonomous systems through ethical, scalable, and adaptive frameworks.

Xiong Junwu is currently engaged in advancing research on  **scalable reinforcement learning (RL) and agentic alignment** in LLM foundation models complex reasoning abilities. His work focuses on developing advanced algorithms and frameworks with super high-quality data, including R1/O1-related scalable RL alignment, post-training methods such as RLXF and SFT, and AI alignment strategies, with partial involvement in multimodal interaction and a keen interest in controllable AIGC. His previous work lie in advancing RL, and multi-agent learning systems, encompassing both off-policy and on-policy approaches as well as cooperative and competitive multi-agent frameworks. Additionally, his research spans preference learning, pricing, marketing, and recommendation systems.


<!-- By integrating **post-training alignment frameworks** (e.g., RLHF, SFT) with  **agent foundation models** , he addresses adaptability challenges in dynamic, multi-agent systems. His innovations span **off-policy/on-policy RL algorithms** for cooperative-competitive scenarios, preference learning, and real-world applications like financial pricing, marketing, and cloud resource allocation. A critical thrust involves **controllable AIGC** and multi-agent frameworks that balance scalability with ethical alignment, particularly in high-stakes financial and green tech domains. Recent extensions into **multimodal interaction** aim to unify sensory data with decision processes, enabling agents to synthesize heterogeneous inputs for robust, context-aware actions. -->

<!-- ### **Past Work (2011–2022)**
Since earning his master’s degree from Beihang University in 2011, Xiong Junwu has built an impactful career. He began at City University of Hong Kong, researching multimedia algorithms, followed by a role at Baidu developing large-scale distributed personalized mining systems. At Renren’s Application Research Center with Tsinghua University, he led the creation of the first ultra-large-scale social network recommendation system. At Alibaba’s Hand Tao, he spearheaded the inaugural real-time scenario-based recommendation system. Now at Ant Group, as a Senior Algorithm Expert, he drives innovative decision-making solutions for dynamic, complex scenarios. His algorithms underpin fund asset pricing, consumer finance modeling, equity recommendations, and cloud resource scheduling, enhancing efficiency for billions of users. He has published extensively at ICML and NeurIPS and holds numerous patents.

Dr. Xiong’s career trajectory reflects a consistent drive to translate algorithmic innovation into industrial-scale impact. Beginning with multimedia research (CityU HK) and pioneering large-scale recommendation systems (Baidu, Renren, Alibaba), he evolved toward **dynamic decision-making under complexity** at Ant Group. There, he developed RL frameworks for financial pricing, multi-agent bidding, and cloud resource optimization—advancing both theoretical rigor (ICML/NeurIPS publications) and societal utility (enhancing resource efficiency for billions). This progression—from distributed systems to agentic intelligence—underscores his ethos:  **scalable, adaptive solutions that reconcile real-world constraints with emerging AI capabilities** , a philosophy now central to his alignment research and multimodal agent frameworks. -->
